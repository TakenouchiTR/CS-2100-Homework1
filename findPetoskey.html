                <h2>What is a Petoskey Stone?</h2>
                <p>
                    Around 350 to 400 million years ago the land we know as Michigan was located near the equator.
                    Covered by a warm, shallow, saltwater sea, the colonial coral Hexagonaria Percarinata thrived with
                    other marine life in tropical reefs. The earth’s plates moved and pushed Michigan north to the 45th
                    parallel and above sea level, which created dry land formations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    More recently, about two million years ago, glacial action scraped the earth and spread the fossils
                    across the northern Lower Peninsula, depositing major concentrations in the Petoskey area. The
                    prehistoric fossil, unique to the Traverse Group rock strata, is called the Petoskey Stone and is
                    Michigan’s official state stone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A Petoskey Stone consists of tightly packed, six-sided corallites, which are the skeletons of the
                    once-living cor-al polyps. The dark center (or eyes) were the mouth of the coral. The lines
                    surrounding the eyes were once tentacles which brought food into the mouth. The Petoskey Stone,
                    like the city, was named for the Ottawa Chief Pe-to-se-ga (Rising Sun) because the stones pattern
                    looks like the rays of the sun. When dry, the stone resembles ordinary limestone but when wet or
                    polished using lapidary techniques, the distinctive mottled pattern of the six-sided coral fossils
                    emerges.

                    <dt>Petoskey State Park:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        With two miles of shoreline on Little Traverse Bay (and Lake Michigan), this is a natural for
                        novices as well as experienced rockhounds. Located on 303 acres between Petoskey and Harbor
                        Springs off <abbr title="Highway">Hwy.</abbr> M-119. Recreation passport required for entry.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Magnus City Park Beach:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Easy access to the waterfront and Petoskey Stone hunting at this park with 1,000 feet of beach.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Bay Front & Sunset Park:</dt>
                    <dd>

                <h2>Polish it up!</h2>

                <img src="images/DryPetoskeyStone.jpg" alt="A photo of a dry Petoskey stone." width="249" height="201">

                <p>
                    Dry Petoskey Stones usually look like ordinary limestone in a color range from light grey to dark
                    grey. The distinctive, six-sided “rays of the rising sun” pattern pops when the rock’s surface is
                    wet, which is why it’s easier to spy Petoskey Stones along the shore or by wading out into the
                    water. If you’re hunting in a dry area carry a water bottle to spray likely candidates to bring
                    out that pattern.

                <p>Polishing the Petoskey Stone at home is easily accomplished by using sand paper!</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Using a relatively coarse grade sand paper, remove the larger pits and imperfections in the
                        stone
                    </li>
                    <li>Gradually use to finer grades of sandpaper to further smooth out pits and imperfections.</li>
                    <li>Smooth out sanding marks with very fine steel wool, or wet/dry sand paper</li>
                    <li>Polish with leather or cloth soaked in oil</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Do not use a rock tumbler, as the Petoskey stone is too soft and will be damaged.</p>

                    Of course we can't know for sure what the colonial coral Hexagonaria Percarinata looked like, but
                    many believe this is how it would have appeared 350-400 Millions Years Ago.
