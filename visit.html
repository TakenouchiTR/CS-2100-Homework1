                <h2>A Four Season Community</h2>
                <p>
                    Overlooking the shores of Lake Michigan's Little Traverse Bay in the northern tip of Michigan's
                    Lower Peninsula you'll find Petoskey Michigan. A quaint resort community with unmatched beauty
                    and charm, Petoskey has been a destination for more than 100-years. People return to soak in
                    the rich views, breathe the clean air, eat at world-class restaurants and shop in the specialty
                    shops and boutiques of its historic downtown.
                </p>

                                Estimates are not comparable to other geographic levels due to methodology differences that
                                may exist between different data sources.
                            
                                Some estimates presented here come from sample data, and thus have sampling errors that may
                                render some apparent differences between geographies statistically indistinguishable.
                            
                                The vintage year (e.g., V2019) refers to the final year of the series (2010 thru 2019).
                                Different vintage years of estimates are not comparable.
