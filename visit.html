            Welcome to Petoskey, Michigan
            A Four Season Community
            Overlooking the shores of Lake Michigan's Little Traverse Bay in the northern tip of Michigan's
            Lower Peninsula you'll find Petoskey Michigan. A quaint resort community with unmatched beauty
            and charm, Petoskey has been a destination for more than 100-years. People return to soak in
            the rich views, breathe the clean air, eat at world-class restaurants and shop in the specialty
            shops and boutiques of its historic downtown.
        
            As you plan your vacation in and around Petoskey, please feel free to use the abundant information
            on our web site to discover information for Petoskey, Walloon Lake, Harbor Springs, Alanson, and
            Pellston. You can learn about the famous Petoskey stone and why Ernest Hemingway proudly called this
            area home for so many years. You'll also learn about the great outdoor recreation opportunities
            that include bike trails, cross country ski trails, boating, fishing, and of course the Midwest's
            best downhill skiing. You'll find information about the famous resort communities of historic Bay
            View and the more recently developed Bay Harbor.

            Value Notes
            Estimates are not comparable to other geographic levels due to methodology differences that
            may exist between different data sources.
        
            Some estimates presented here come from sample data, and thus have sampling errors that may
            render some apparent differences between geographies statistically indistinguishable.
        
            The vintage year (e.g., V2019) refers to the final year of the series (2010 thru 2019).
            Different vintage years of estimates are not comparable.
